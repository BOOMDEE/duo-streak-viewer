# 🦉 DuoStreak-Viewer: The Ambient Pulse

A highly aesthetic, serverless digital monument that monitors Duolingo streaks in real-time, running on the edge via Cloudflare Workers.

### 🚀 Philosophy
I wasn't satisfied with just a flame icon in an app. I needed a **minimalist, raw, and atmospheric** web interface to visualize my consistency. This project transforms raw API data into a living, breathing digital pulse.

- **Respiratory Typography**: A massive 10rem streak counter with dynamic `letter-spacing` animation, simulating a physical heartbeat.
- **Dual-Layer Ambient Glow**: Two-tier particle interference animations that mimic the rhythmic ripples of Hangzhou's West Lake.
- **Geospatial Color Matrix**: Automatically detects visitor location (CN, FR, US, HK, etc.) and shifts the theme's hue dynamically.
- **Extreme Robustness**: Successfully handled **119,664+** requests monthly, featuring graceful 502/504 error handling for high-load scenarios.
